# Elements
A chrome extension that helps you control HTML5 video on websites.

## Why tho?
I consume a lot of video on the web and I often do this at 1.5x / 2x speed. Most players offer some way of setting the playback speed. 

However there're plenty that don't, so this extension is an attempt to build a consistent interface for me to control video on the web.
